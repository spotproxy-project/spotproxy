# SpotProxy

SpotProxy is a cloud-native censorship resistance system that aims to minimize the cost of cloud-hosted proxies by co-opting cloud-native features for circumvention. 

Our current iteration of the project uses cost-effective and high-churn cloud instances to maximize the circumvention utility of cloud-hosted proxies. To achieve this, SpotProxy designs a circumvention infrastructure that constantly searches for cheaper VMs and refreshes the fleet for anti-blocking, with negligible downtime from the user's perspective. On this front, SpotProxy is currently compatible with Snowflake and Wireguard.

**We are actively developing the project. However, as of now, SpotProxy is not production-ready.**

## ü§ù Contributions

We are actively searching for collaborators to advance our mission of reducing cloud costs via co-opting cloud-native features for circumvention, of which SpotProxy is merely the first step. Please reach out to Patrick if you would like to contribute! We welcome and value all contributions to the project!
